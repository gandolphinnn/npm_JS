# Rigid
'RigidRect' and 'RigictCirc' are used to define an object (a rectangle/square and a circle) with coordinates, direction in degrees and dimension.
It provides functions to determine if it hits or not another RigidObject and the new direction if it bounce on a wall.
It's not intended to be used for graphic purposes but just for game logic.
